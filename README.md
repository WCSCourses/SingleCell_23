## Course overview

Single-cell sequencing technologies are powerful tools used to assess genomic, transcriptomic and proteomics information at the single-cell level. In recent years, the application of techniques that use single-cell sequencing have become increasingly common in several areas of research: including medicine, agriculture, and other life sciences disciplines. Single-cell sequencing may be used to study many aspects of an organism’s biology, both in health and disease, and the results of these studies contribute immensely to advancing the understanding of organisms as a whole. 

Illustrated by the successful formation of scientific networks within the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/biological-networks/), there is growing interest among scientists and increased need for building capacity for single cell technologies. However, there is a lack of infrastructure, limited funding, and expertise  relevant for applying these advanced technologies in Latin America. Therefore, this short course offers hands-on laboratory training and bioinformatics analysis in single-cell technologies to contribute to capacity development in Latin America.

## Hands-On Bioinformatics Training Material

Below, you will find the links to the pre-course videos and Google Colab notebooks for the practical modules. 

### Pre-course Videos:

- [Plotting in R for Biologists:](https://lms.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/course/view.php?id=106)
_This material provides an introduction to the R programming language, which is extensively used in bioinformatics and will be crucial in all the modules implemented over the course._
- [Introduction to Linux for Biologists:](https://lms.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/course/view.php?id=107)
_This material covers the basics of shell scripting, a powerful tool for automating tasks and data processing in bioinformatics._
- [Get started with Google Colaboratory:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI)
_This video provides a basic understanding of Google Colaboratory or Google Colab and their notebooks structure, which is the web-based interactive computing platform that we will be using along with our bioinformatics practical work._

## Practical Modules with Google Colab Notebooks:

- [Notebook 01 - Processing raw scRNA-seq data](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PmK1h4ECQgjoVJmVguz3rlwLorThhafD?ouid=109970662236337661286&usp=drive_link):
_Processing raw single-cell sequencing data (scRNA-seq) is a crucial step in the whole pipeline analysis of scRNA-Seq experiments. Depending on the library preparation method used, the RNA sequences will be acquired either from 3’ ends (or 5’ ends) of the transcripts (10X Genomics, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, inDrops) or from full-length transcripts (Smart-seq). The choice of a specific method will depend entirely on the biological question and the downstream analysis to be implemented from a count matrix. In this notebook we will cover theoretical and practical steps in setting up from raw sequences (reads)to count matrix analysis pipelines, as well as explore the basic output of the Cell Ranger tool._
